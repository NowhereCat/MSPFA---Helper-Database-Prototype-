# MSPFA---Helper-Database-Prototype-
This was a prototype program for a character database for my MSPFA tool.

This is just a proof of concept for a Python program that would go to a SQLite database and retrive info about characters (like how they type and such).

It was an activity so I could train on how to program in Python and pratice SQLite
